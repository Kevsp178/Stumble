## Notes

I encontered all of the following challenges with this project
- Finding an API to use
- reading through and understanding how to apply the API
- calling the API in my project for it to begin displaying the pictures
- call a fetch for the information
- further more the information was not matching with the pictures
- call the images and information by .id in order for the fetching to brign the accurate information
